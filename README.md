# QuakerTracker

![screenshot](img/screencapture.png)

## About this app
Uses pandas, plotly/dash, and USGS data to create a global visualization of 
recent earthquakes with a magnitude of â‰¥ 2.5.


Seen a simple example of something similar while doom scrolling social media
and thought I could do a little better. Really just an excuse to spend a lazy Sunday 
doing a refresher on Plotly/Dash.
